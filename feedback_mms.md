## Project Workflow

> Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Good stories.  I don't see any evidence of further planning.  I have to agree with you, it can help. :)  

## Technical Requirements

> Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few weeks of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems.  That progress bar is pretty cool.

## Code Quality

> Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Good job. Html is clearly structured. Javascript is extracted into objects and functions, with decent names (usually).  In the future, it may be helpful to orgamize your files into directories (especially the various images).  It would also be helpful to spend time cleaning and polishing (e.g. removing commented css, empty or unused files, etc.)

## Problem Solving

> Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations**.  Nice progression through your commits.  I especially appreciated "progress bar working?".  In the future, I recommend you start on css before midnight, the last night.  :)


Did someone say "Astronomical Clock Road Trip!"?
